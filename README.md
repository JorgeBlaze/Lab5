Using AllTalk API with C#

Issue list
1. Cloning alltalk repo from GitHub:I used git installed locally to clone the repo, but it wouldn't take an arguement for a destination folder so it just cloned to a temp folder. i bypassed this and placed alltalk in the lab5 files so it could be installed from there--just need to change the path
2. Opening alltalk service in a window: i thought this would be easy, but it took a while to get the service to open in a new cmd window instead of taking over the program window--I used the ProcessStartInfo class with createnowindow = false and that worked
3.
